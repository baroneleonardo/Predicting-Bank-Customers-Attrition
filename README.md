# Predicting Bank Customers Attrition
"Applied Statistics" project repository

### Abstract
Customer attrition poses a significant challenge for banks as it leads to revenue loss, reduced market share, and customer loyalty. Understanding the reasons behind customer churn is crucial for proactive retention strategies, including improving service, personalisation, and addressing pain points to build stronger customer relationships and mitigate attrition.
The objective of our project is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts customer attrition. By doing so, we aim to optimize the companyâ€™s budget by focusing retention campaigns on customers who are most likely to leave. This data-driven approach allows for personalized and targeted efforts, increasing the effectiveness of retention strategies and ultimately reducing customer churn.
